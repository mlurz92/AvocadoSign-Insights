First, we applied the 2016 ESGAR consensus criteria, which represent a widely recognized clinical standard, to their respective target populations within our cohort ${helpers.getReference('Beets_Tan_2018')}. Second, to establish the most stringent internal comparator, a data-driven benchmark was developed via a systematic, computer-assisted analysis (Brute-Force) that exhaustively tested all permutations of T2 features and logical operators to identify the combination with the highest diagnostic performance for a pre-selected metric (${bruteForceMetricForPublication}). Third, to contextualize our findings further, we applied several additional T2-based criteria sets from previously published studies to their appropriate cohorts. All evaluated criteria sets are detailed in Table 2.</p>
