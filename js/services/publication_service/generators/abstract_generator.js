The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee with a waiver of additional informed consent. Two abdominal radiologists, blinded to pathology and each other, independently assessed the Avocado Sign on contrast-enhanced Dixon-VIBE images in dedicated sessions. Diagnostic performance was benchmarked against (i) exhaustive brute-force optimisation of T2-weighted morphologic combinations for a predefined metric and (ii) guideline-derived literature criteria applied to the appropriate cohorts. Histopathology from total mesorectal excision served as the reference standard. Confidence intervals were computed with Wilson or bootstrap methods, and AUCs were compared using the DeLong test.</p>`;

The Avocado Sign yielded an AUC of ${asAucText}, sensitivity of ${asSensText}, and specificity of ${asSpecText}. The best-performing, data-driven T2 benchmark achieved an AUC of ${bfAucText}, remaining inferior to the Avocado Sign (${pValueText}).
