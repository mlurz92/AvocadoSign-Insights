**Lee S, Kassam Z, Baheti AD, et al. Rectal cancer lexicon 2023 revised and updated consensus statement from the Society of Abdominal Radiology Colorectal and Anal Cancer Disease-Focused Panel. Abdom Radiol (NY). 2023;48(9):2792-2806. DOI: 10.1007/s00261-023-03893-2**

**Study Aim**
To provide a revised and updated consensus statement on the terminology, classification, and imaging standards for rectal cancer, reflecting the expert opinion of the Society of Abdominal Radiology (SAR) Colorectal and Anal Cancer Disease-Focused Panel.

**Key Concepts and Recommendations (Consensus Statement)**

*   **Primary Tumor Staging:**
    *   **T1 vs. T2 Differentiation:** The lexicon introduces the "submucosal enhancing stripe sign" on post-contrast MRI as a helpful feature to differentiate T1 from T2 tumors, acknowledging the value of contrast-enhanced sequences for specific staging questions.
    *   **MRF vs. CRM:** Recommends using the term "Mesorectal Fascia (MRF)" as an anatomic term in radiology reports, rather than "Circumferential Resection Margin (CRM)," which is a surgical term.

*   **Nodal Staging:**
    *   **Standard Criteria:** Confirms the adoption of the "Dutch Criteria" (combining size and morphology) by both ESGAR and SAR as the standard for initial staging of mesorectal nodes.
    *   **Performance:** Acknowledges that despite these criteria, the **sensitivity of MRI for N-classification remains "mediocre."** This explicitly highlights the persistent challenges and limitations of T2-based nodal staging.
    *   **Reporting Recommendation:** The DFP recommends using a simplified classification of **"N+" or "N-"** in MRI reports, rather than attempting to specify sub-stages like N1 or N2, due to the limited accuracy in assessing the exact number of involved nodes.
    *   **Restaging Criteria:** For restaging after neoadjuvant therapy, the lexicon states that size criteria are used, with a mesorectal node measuring **> 5 mm** in short axis being considered suspicious. The Dutch morphological criteria are noted as no longer applicable in the post-treatment setting.
    *   **Tumor Deposits:** Highlights that tumor deposits are a distinct entity (N1c) with a worse prognosis and provides morphologic descriptors to help differentiate them from lymph nodes.

*   **Imaging Protocol:**
    *   **High-Resolution T2WI:** Defines high-resolution T2-weighted imaging as having an in-plane resolution of approximately 0.6 × 0.6 mm and a slice thickness of 3 mm, resulting in a voxel size of about 1.08 mm³. This provides a clear benchmark for image quality.
    *   **DWI:** Recommends the use of DWI with a high b-value (≥ 800) and ADC mapping, noting its value for tumor localization and assessing treatment response, but acknowledging its limitations for primary T or N classification.

**Conclusion Summary**
This 2023 lexicon update from a major radiological society serves as an authoritative guide to modern rectal cancer imaging. It reinforces the central role of high-quality MRI while candidly acknowledging its limitations, particularly the "mediocre" sensitivity of standard T2-based criteria for nodal staging. The document's recommendations to simplify N-stage reporting to "N+/-" and its introduction of specific contrast-enhanced signs for T-staging underscore a move towards more practical and robust imaging assessment, creating a strong rationale for investigating novel, more accurate markers like the Avocado Sign.
