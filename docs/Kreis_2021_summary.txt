**Study Aim**
To report on the surgical quality and histopathological outcomes from the prospective, multicenter, observational OCUM trial, which used pre-therapeutic MRI findings to selectively indicate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for patients with rectal carcinoma.

**Methods**
*   **Study Design:** Prospective, multicenter, observational study (OCUM trial).
*   **Patient Population:** 1100 patients recruited between 2007 and 2016. The final analysis included 1091 patients from 14 centers.
*   **Intervention Strategy (MRI-based selection for nCRT):**
    *   **nCRT was indicated for high-risk patients** based on MRI. High-risk was defined as:
        1.  Involved or threatened mesorectal fascia (**mrMRF+**, distance ≤ 1 mm).
        2.  **cT4** tumors.
        3.  **cT3** tumors located in the **lower rectal third**.
    *   Patients not meeting these criteria (low-risk) proceeded directly to primary surgery (total mesorectal excision - TME).
*   **Endpoints:** This paper focuses on secondary endpoints: quality of mesorectal excision, pathological circumferential resection margin (pCRM) involvement, and factors influencing pCRM positivity. The primary endpoints (5-year local recurrence and overall survival) were to be reported later.

**Key Results (beyond Abstract)**
*   **Patient Stratification and Treatment:**
    *   Of 875 patients treated per protocol, 527 (60.2%) underwent primary surgery (low-risk group) and 348 (39.8%) underwent nCRT followed by surgery (high-risk group).
    *   **Reliability of mrMRF assessment:** The distance to the mrMRF could be determined in 94.5% of patients. In the primary surgery group, only 4.6% were initially classified as mrMRF+, compared to 80.7% in the nCRT group, confirming successful risk stratification.

*   **Surgical Quality (in the 875 per-protocol patients):**
    *   The quality of surgery was high across all centers.
    *   **Plane of Surgery:** Resection was in the correct mesorectal plane in 90.9% of cases.
    *   **Nerve Sparing:** Autonomic pelvic nerves were preserved on both sides in 98.3% of surgeries.
    *   **Lymph Node Yield:** The median number of examined lymph nodes was 23 in the primary surgery group and 17 in the nCRT group. Overall, 98.5% of primary surgery patients and 90.8% of nCRT patients had ≥ 12 nodes examined.

*   **Pathological Outcomes:**
    *   **R0 Resection:** Achieved in 98.3% of the 875 protocol patients.
    *   **pCRM Status:** A negative pCRM (>1 mm) was achieved in **95.1%** of patients.
    *   **pCRM in Low-Risk Patients:** In the subgroup of 600 patients with clinical stage II/III tumors in the lower/middle rectum, 268 were classified as low-risk (mrMRF-) and did not receive nCRT. Of these, **260 (97.0%) had a negative pCRM**. Only 8 patients (3.0%) were pCRM-positive, suggesting this undertreatment risk is balanced against avoiding nCRT in 97% of these patients.
    *   **Risk Factors for pCRM Positivity (Multivariate Analysis):**
        *   Advanced tumor stage (pT4/ypT4): OR 48.9
        *   Metastatic lymph nodes (pN1/ypN1 and pN2/ypN2): OR 2.5 and 5.2 respectively
        *   Resection in the muscularis propria plane: OR 9.4
        *   Tumor location in the lower third: OR 7.0

*   **Complete Pathological Response (pCR):** In the nCRT group, 10.9% of patients achieved a pCR (ypT0, ypN0).

**Conclusion**
The risk classification of rectal cancer patients based on pre-therapeutic MRI (specifically mrMRF status and tumor location/T-stage) is highly reliable. This strategy allows the restriction of nCRT to approximately 40-50% of patients with clinical stage II/III rectal carcinoma, thereby avoiding overtreatment in a large proportion of patients. This approach is contingent upon a high-quality, standardized MRI protocol, expert radiological interpretation, and high-quality TME surgery.
