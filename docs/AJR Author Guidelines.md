# **Guidelines for Authors**

Authors must submit all manuscripts using the online submission and peer review system at [https://www.editorialmanager.com/ajr](https://www.editorialmanager.com/ajr).

Submission and peer review questions should be addressed to: AJRsubmit@arrs.org

Please refer to the description below of *AJR's* policy for [flexible formatting](https://ajronline.org/authorguidelines#flexibleformatting) for initial submissions.

### **General Information**

The *AJR* publishes high-quality clinically oriented articles in all radiology subspecialties. The journal publishes a variety of article types, including original research, reviews, and editorials, covering a spectrum of interpretive and noninterpretive topics. Studies should be relevant to radiologists' clinical practice.

Submitted articles will first be assessed by editorial board members. Manuscripts will be evaluated with respect to novelty, impact, rigor, and suitability of the material for the journal's general radiology audience. The editorial board may render a final decision based on its evaluation of the submission or choose to send the manuscript for external peer review using a double-blind review process. External reviewers will be provided a 10-day window to complete their review to facilitate a rapid decision. A comprehensive technical check to ensure compliance with journal guidelines will be performed whenif a revision is requested from the authors. The Editor in Chief will issue the final acceptance for all articles.

Accepted articles are published as Accepted Manuscripts shortly after acceptance, at which time they receive a DOI and are available through PubMed. The Accepted Manuscript is later replaced by the article’s version of record, following the copyediting, typesetting, page layout, and proof review processes.

All journal content is made freely accessible 1 year after publication of the version of record. Select content is made freely accessible immediately at publication.

# **Author Guide for Original Research**

#### **General guidance regarding retrospective reader-based studies**

* Retrospective reader-based diagnostic performance studies should include independent readers. In general, consensus readings are discouraged as they do not mirror the independent readings that radiologists typically provide in clinical practice. It is more helpful to demonstrate the range of sensitivities and specificities attained by independent readers. A larger number of readers is encouraged to help adequately convey how diagnostic performance varies across radiologists. A larger number of readers also increases the authoritativeness of the work and will enhance the study’s overall impact.  
* Retrospective reader-based studies associating a panel of imaging findings with a clinical endpoint should generally include a multivariable analysis to identify the strongest independent predictors. A lengthy list of imaging findings is of little practical use for reading images. Typically only two or three of these findings drive diagnostic performance, while the remaining features provide confounding information and may be confusing or distracting for readers to apply. A regression or other model should be incorporated into the study analysis to inform the reader of the few features on which to rely in clinical practice.

#### **Title**

* The title should provide an objective overview of the work that was performed, indicating the focus of the study's methods and results.  
* The title should convey unique aspects of the study design (e.g., a multicenter study, based on a national survey).

#### **Abstract**

* The Abstract should be able to stand on its own without the rest of the manuscript. For example, all Abstract results should correspond to methods described in the Abstract, and the Abstract conclusion should be fully supported by the Abstract results without depending on results found only within the main manuscript.  
* The Abstract results should provide numeric results and not just qualitative summaries of the data. Provide specific data in addition to *p* values.  
* The Abstract conclusion should be consistent with the conclusion of the main manuscript.

#### **Introduction**

* The Introduction should be focused on the specific research question and not serve as a broad review of the topic.  
* The Introduction should define a gap in knowledge and communicate how the authors intend to address that gap.  
  Example: If the study’s objective is to compare the diagnostic performance of different DWI b values for a particular clinical condition, then the Introduction should be focused on existing knowledge regarding b-value optimization for the condition, including areas of uncertainty in the literature. The Introduction should not provide a lengthy discussion about the clinical condition or the role of DWI in general for that condition but instead should focus on issues of b-value optimization.  
* The Introduction should make clear the importance of the provided research question.  
* The Introduction should conclude with a clear statement of the study aim that closely matches the objective provided in the Abstract. All core elements within the study objective should be introduced in the Introduction prior to the aim statement itself; the reader should be able to anticipate the purpose statement by having read the remainder of the Introduction.  
  Example: If the study’s objective is to compare the PPV of T1- and T2-weighted MRI sequences for a given condition, then the Introduction should earlier make mention of PPV as well as of both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.  
* Extensive background information, as may be encountered in a review article or textbook chapter, should be avoided as beyond the scope of the investigation. If the Introduction describes existing literature on the topic, then it should be clear how the present study is different from that literature.

#### **Methods**

* The Methods section is usually stratified into subsections (e.g., Patients, Image Acquisition, Image Interpretation, Reference Standard, and Statistical Analysis).  
* In the first paragraph, affirm HIPAA compliance for studies performed in the U.S. as well as the study’s IRB status (e.g., IRB approval, IRB waiver, IRB oversight not required). If you assert that a study did not require IRB oversight, include a reason. For IRB-approved studies, indicate whether verbal or written informed consent was obtained from patients or if informed consent was waived.  
* Clearly indicate the initial search criteria as well as subsequent study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Provide the number of patients initially identified and the number of patients excluded for each reason that is provided. The selection process should be presented in a logical sequence whereby each step in the sequential flow represents a natural subset of remaining eligible patients up to that point.  
  Example: If the manuscript initially states that only patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT were selected, then the flow should not subsequently indicate exclusion of patients who did not undergo CT or who were unable to receive IV contrast media.  
  Make clear whether the study was retrospective or prospective as well as whether or not patients were identified consecutively. Indicate the calendar dates encompassing the patient sample. Prepare a Figure 1 flowchart, ensuring that the patient selection process matches between this chart and the article text (i.e., presents exclusions that are listed in the same order and phrased in a comparable manner).  
* Clearly indicate who conducted which steps of the study. Indicate if there was a study coordinator who searched institutional databases or the electronic health record, identified the cohort, or prepared image sets for retrospective review, etc.  
* Describe readers’ image evaluations in detail. Indicate whether readings were performed independently or in consensus and, if in consensus, how consensus was achieved in the event of discrepancies. Indicate the readers’ backgrounds and years of posttraining experience. Indicate the details of any training session prior to the readings. For qualitative imaging features assessed by the readers, indicate the criteria for each possible option that the readers could assign for the feature. For quantitative imaging features, indicate how the readers performed the measurements. Indicate details of reader blinding (e.g., to patients’ histories, other diagnoses, earlier imaging examinations).  
* Clearly indicate the reference standard. For diagnoses determined based on imaging or clinical follow-up, be explicit regarding the follow-up criteria.  
* Provide methods for any post hoc subjective assessments performed by the readers in addition to their primary image analysis.  
  Example: If after the formal reader evaluations and initial statistical analysis, a subjective assessment was performed to explore the causes of incorrect readings, the Methods section should describe how this post hoc assessment was performed.  
* For AI/ML studies of in-house tools that are not available to the public, provide a link to a repository (e.g., Github) with the code for the given tool.  
* If there are earlier publications that may be similar to the present study, or if there are earlier studies with overlapping patient cohorts, then cite these earlier studies. Provide the nature of the similarity or the number of overlapping patients, and explain what is unique about the present study.

#### **Results**

##### **General considerations**

* The Results section is usually stratified into subsections based on related components of the analysis.  
* All results should directly correspond with a step mentioned in the Methods section. This includes subjective, qualitative, or post hoc assessments performed after the initial reader evaluations (e.g., to explore causes of reader inaccuracies).  
* Provide direct results and not judgments or interpretation of the results. For example, avoid statements such as “feature X was an excellent predictor of outcome Y.” In the absence of explicit criteria for excellent performance, this would not represent a direct observation but rather an interpretation of the data; others could consider the same results to not represent excellent performance.

##### **Reporting data**

* Report all data of a particular type (e.g., all percentages or all measurements of a given quantitative imaging metric) to the same number of decimal places throughout the Results, which should match the number of decimal places used in the Tables and the Abstract.  
* Provide numerators and denominators for all percentages, whether in the text or tables.  
* Report *p* values greater than or equal to .01 to two decimal places and *p* values less than .01 to three decimal places. However, report *p* values in the range of .045 to .049 to three decimal places rather than rounding to *p* \= .05. Report a maximum *p* value as *p* \> .99 rather than p \= 1.00. Report very small *p* values as *p* \< .001 rather than reporting the exact *p* value to a larger number of decimal places. When reporting a single *p* value (aside from *p* \< .001), report the exact *p* value rather than reporting the single *p* value as an inequality relative to a threshold (e.g., *p* \< .01 or *p* \> .05). Because *p* values are always less than 1, do not place a zero before the decimal point; this saves space in the text and tables. Also, use *p* rather than *p* value when the term appears in parentheses or in tables.  
* When reporting significant p values, also report the numeric values for the actual data being compared by the *p* value. The *p* values themselves do not represent underlying data but rather indicate the confidence that a given finding is statistically significant. Likewise, avoid broad statements that two groups were “different” as this does not indicate the directionality or magnitude of the difference.

#### **Discussion**

* The first paragraph of the Discussion should provide a plainly stated summary of the study’s most important findings rather than a repeat of the Introduction or a broad overview of the topic.  
* The Discussion should include a comparison of the findings with existing literature, explaining any discrepancies.  
* The Discussion should remain focused on the data at hand, avoiding lengthy ancillary commentary that could have been written without having conducted the given study.  
* The Discussion should make explicit the study’s impact, indicating how the findings will influence radiologic practice. Address why readers should care about the study’s findings.  
* In general, the Discussion should include a Limitations paragraph as the second to last paragraph.  
* The Discussion should conclude with a short paragraph highlighting the main finding and implication. This should mirror the Abstract conclusion.  
* The Discussion should not serve as a platform for the authors to advance their own views on the topic beyond what is supported by the provided data.  
  Example: If the study’s objective is to compare two MRI sequences for a given diagnosis and all of the provided data relate to those two sequences, then the Discussion should avoid a lengthy discussion of why MRI is preferred over other imaging modalities for the given diagnosis.  
* The Discussion should not include an overly detailed repetition of numeric findings from the Results.  
* The Discussion should not provide new information regarding the study sample that did not already appear earlier in the article, even if qualitative, subjective, or post hoc in nature. Such observations should be provided in the Results section, supported by corresponding material in the Methods section.  
* The Discussion should not overstate the importance of the work or recommend widespread changes in clinical practice based on an initial or small pilot study. The Discussion section may indicate the need for larger studies or other further validation, as appropriate.

### **General Guidelines for All Submissions**

* For initial submission, the manuscript should be blinded so as to not reveal the authors’ identity. Authors’ names and affiliations should not appear anywhere in the manuscript text or images. Redact authors’ initials within the Methods section.  
* References should not be redacted as this may indirectly identify the authors and thereby unblind the work. References to the authors’ earlier work should be provided in the third person (e.g., “as shown by an earlier investigation”) and maintain the full citation rather than being described in the first person (e.g., “as shown in an earlier study by our group”) with a redacted citation.  
* Authors will be asked in Editorial Manager if there are any publications, including manuscripts accepted or under review, that might be regarded as very similar to the submission or that may have overlap in patient cohort with the submission. In the event of prior similar work or an overlapping patient cohort, the authors will be asked to explain the nature of the overlap. The Methods section of the manuscript should cite the overlapping work and explain the difference between the prior and current studies. PDFs of overlapping publications should be uploaded with the submission.  
* All submissions are processed automatically through Similarity Check. Authors will need to appropriately address any duplicative content before acceptance.  
* Authors will be asked in Editorial Manager to provide a copy of any prior abstract or presentation on which the submission is based.  
* *Preprints:* Material that has been posted on a preprint server (e.g., medRxiv) can be submitted to *AJR*. If the work has been posted as a preprint, authors must provide the preprint DOI link at the time of submission. If the work is accepted by *AJR*, the preprint posting must be updated to include the DOI and URL link for the published *AJR* article. Authors may not post the published article or any interim versions produced during the peer review process on the preprint server.  
* *Generative AI:* Authors must disclose the use of large language models or other generative AI technologies in the manuscript’s preparation, including specific details regarding the relevant manuscript content, the particular technology applied (including name, version number, and manufacturer), and the manner in which the technology was used to create the content. Authors are responsible for any submitted materials created by generative AI technologies, including ensuring the accuracy of such material, the absence of plagiarism, and the appropriate attribution of sources.  
* *Commercial conflicts of interest:* Authors will be asked in Editorial Manager if any author is an employee of a company or other commercial entity related to the submitted work. If answering affirmatively, authors will also be asked to provide further details (including the commercial entity, the author(s)' relationship with the entity, and the author(s)' contribution toward the submitted work) and to attest whether authors who are not employees of the commercial entity had full control of the data and information submitted for publication. The contribution of the author(s) having the relationship with the commercial entity should also be disclosed in a blinded fashion in the article's Methods section.  
* *Accelerated review pathway:* For imaging-related manuscripts rejected after undergoing peer review by select leading general medical journals (*NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, BMJ,* or *Annals of Internal Medicine*), authors may include a copy of the earlier decision letter and peer reviews when submitting the manuscript to *AJR*. The submission should include a statement that such materials are provided in their entirety and without alteration. We will aim to use these reviews to provide a rapid decision. At the discretion of the editorial board, additional reviews may be solicited.

### **Copyright and Permissions**

* The online submission system provides an option for uploading permission documents. Guidance regarding needed documentation will be provided during the revision process. All copyright- and permission-related issues must be resolved before acceptance.  
* Material that is reproduced exactly from published material requires the copyright holder’s permission to reproduce the material in electronic media. Examples include figures, tables, abstracts of prior presentations, appendixes, and quoted material of more than 50 words from a single source. Material that is not reproduced exactly but that is substantially similar to published material requires the copyright holder’s permission to adapt or modify in electronic media. For reprinted or adapted materials, the originally published version should be provided in addition to the permission documentation.  
* For material created by a nonauthor that has not been published, including artwork and photographs, documentation is required from the nonauthor that identifies the material, states that the nonauthor holds its copyright, and states that ARRS has permission to publish the material in electronic media. If the nonauthor is not the copyright holder, documentation from the copyright holder is required.  
* For material created by an author that has not been published, including artwork and photographs, copyright will be transferred to the ARRS as part of the submission process, and separate permission documentation is not needed. However, attestation is required identifying the author as the creator of the material and stating that the material is original to the manuscript (i.e., has not been previously published, and no other person or entity can claim copyright to the material).  
* Written or oral communications from nonauthors require written permission from the source of the communication.  
* Names or other identifying information should not appear anywhere in any image or video. If any person is identifiable in an image or video, written consent from the person or their legal representative must be supplied before acceptance. No brands, product logos, or institutional logos should appear in any image or video. Artists’ names included in images should be obscured during the peer review process.

### **Authorship**

* All authors must fulfill all criteria for authorship as described by the [International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Guidelines for Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html). The corresponding author attests to the criteria during the submission process. All coauthors receive an email with a link to a page in which they must attest to fulfilling these criteria.  
* All authors must have approved the submitted manuscript and are deemed accountable for its contents.  
* To add, remove, or change the order of authors after execution of the Copyright Transfer and Author Certification Agreement, the corresponding author must provide an explanation for the reason for the change; all coauthors will receive an email from the journal office to confirm their consent to the change. Adding or removing coauthors, or changing the order of authors, is not allowed after acceptance.

### **Initial Submissions: Flexible Formatting**

* Initial submissions may be organized using any reasonable scientific format (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). The format is flexible, and initial submissions do not need to be in full compliance with journal guidelines. Manuscripts must be properly formatted if a revision is requested.  
* For initial submissions, tables and figures may be incorporated into the text rather than placed at the end of the manuscript.  
* For initial submissions, providing the complete author list in the title page Word document is sufficient. Only the corresponding author's information needs to be entered into the author list in the online submission system. If a revision is requested, all coauthor information needs to be entered in the online submission system when submitting the revision.

### **Revisions**

* Revisions must be submitted through the online peer review system and include the following files:  
* A point-by-point detailed response to the Editors and/or reviewers’ comments, submitted as an MS Word document. Responses should be preceded by the reviewer and comment number (e.g., “Rev 2, Comment 4”) and the text of the reviewer comment.  
* An annotated copy of the revised manuscript with changes tracked or highlighted. Changes should be identified by the reviewer number and comment number in the margins or in the text to make it clear to the Editors and/or reviewers which comment the change is addressing  
* A clean unannotated version of the revised manuscript (without any embedded figures)  
* All figures must be uploaded as individual TIFF or PNG files (even if there are no changes or revisions to the figures)  
* Revisions not adhering to the applicable article type will be returned to the authors to be corrected. Revisions are expected to adhere to such limits after incorporating any content requested by reviewers or editors.

### **Manuscript Organization**

The manuscript is organized as follows: full title page, highlights (when required for the article type), abstract (when required for the article type), main manuscript text, references, tables, figure legends, and figures. Aside from the full title page (and figures for revisions) and supplemental content (if any), all of these components (including highlights and abstract, when required) should be submitted as a single Microsoft Word document. Pages must be numbered consecutively beginning with the abstract. Do not use line numbering.

**Full Title Page**

A separate Microsoft Word document that will not be included in the PDF that goes to the reviewers that contains:

* Title of article  
* Type of article (i.e., article category)  
* Names, academic degrees, email addresses, telephone numbers, complete institutional addresses (including zip code), and X/Twitter handles (if available) of all authors and coauthors with one corresponding author clearly identified. Co-corresponding authors are not allowed. The Full Title Page is the primary source used when determining the final author order at manuscript acceptance.  
* Present affiliations of authors who have moved since the study was completed  
* Funding sources (from grants and other sources)  
* Author disclosures, listed individually. If there are no disclosures, that fact must be explicitly stated.

References

* References are numbered consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text.  
* All references are cited in the text. Reference numbers are enclosed in brackets and are typed on line with the text (not superscripted).  
* Authors are responsible for the accuracy of cited references.  
* Citations from internet sources should provide the name of the author(s), the title of the web page, the URL, the page’s original publication or creation date, and the date the page was accessed.  
* Cited journal articles are retrievable (i.e., published online or in print). Do not cite manuscripts in preparation, under review or revision, or accepted but not yet published in some form.  
* Personal communications are not cited in the reference list but are cited parenthetically in the text, for example: (Smith DJ, written communication, 2023).  
* Papers presented at a meeting are not cited in the reference list but are cited parenthetically in the text, for example: (Smith DJ, et al., presented at the 2003 annual meeting of the American Roentgen Ray Society). After first mention, use (Smith DJ, et al., 2003 ARRS meeting)  
* Style and punctuation of references follow the format illustrated in the following examples. All authors are listed when six or fewer; when seven or more authors, the first three are listed, followed by et al. Inclusive page numbers (e.g., 333–335) are given for all references. Journal names are abbreviated according to Index Medicus.

* Figures should NOT be embedded in table cells as these will not display correctly in the laid-out article.

### **Figures and Figure Legends**

* Legends use *AJR* style: Fig. 1—47-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis. For images depicting a person, supply age, medical condition or diagnosis, and sex, if relevant.  
* All figure parts relating to one patient should have the same figure number. Each image is considered a single part when counting total number of figure parts.  
* Electronic manipulation of images that materially alters the medical information must be identified and the nature of the alterations described.

### **Figure Files**

*Original Submission*

* For the original submission, figures must be embedded in the MS Word document, at the conclusion of the manuscript following the References and any Tables.  
* Figure legends should be directly above or below the corresponding image.

### **Supplemental Content**

* For all article types other than Original Research, Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis, Best Practices, and Research Letter, supplemental content is limited to video files or content not otherwise suitable for inclusion in the primary article.  
* All supplemental Methods, Tables, and Figures must be provided within a SINGLE MS Word file. This file should first contain the supplemental Methods (labeled Supplemental Methods), then all of the supplemental Tables (labeled Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, etc.), followed by all of the supplemental Figures (labeled Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, etc.). The supplemental Methods as well as all supplemental Tables and Figures must be called out in the manuscript text.  
* The supplemental Methods, Tables, and Figures may cite additional references that are not cited in the primary article. These references should be numbered S1, S2, S3, etc., in the order in which they appear in the supplement, with full citation information provided in a Supplemental References section at the conclusion of the supplement.  
* The Supplemental Content will undergo external peer review along with the rest of the manuscript. For accepted manuscripts, the Supplemental Content will be made available without any further corrections, copyediting, or layout by the journal. A statement will be inserted at the start of the Supplement indicating that the Supplemental Content is in the form originally provided by the authors. The authors therefore will be accountable for such material’s accuracy.

### **Procedure for Editor Conflict of Interest**

* Editors with a conflict of interest for a submitted manuscript will be recused from the manuscript's handling, and an alternate editor will oversee the manuscript during the peer review process and render a decision. An independent consulting editor-at-large will handle manuscripts for which the relevant editorial board members all have conflicts of interest.
