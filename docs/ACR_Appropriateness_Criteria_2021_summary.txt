**ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Staging and Disease Monitoring of Rectal Cancer: 2025 Update**

**Study Aim**
To provide updated evidence-based guidelines on the appropriateness of imaging procedures for the staging, restaging, and surveillance of rectal cancer.

**Methodology**
*   **Guideline Development:** A multidisciplinary expert panel reviews current medical literature and rates the appropriateness of imaging procedures for specific clinical scenarios using a 9-point scale.
*   **Appropriateness Categories:**
    *   **Usually Appropriate (Rating 7–9):** Favorable risk-benefit ratio.
    *   **May Be Appropriate (Rating 4–6):** Equivocal risk-benefit ratio.
    *   **Usually Not Appropriate (Rating 1–3):** Unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.

**Key Recommendations (Selected Variants)**

*   **Variant 1: Rectal Cancer - Locoregional Staging (Initial)**
    *   **Usually Appropriate:**
        *   **MRI pelvis without and with IV contrast.**
        *   **MRI pelvis without IV contrast.**
    *   **Rationale/Discussion Summary:** MRI is the preferred modality for its high-resolution depiction of the rectal wall and mesorectal fascia. The guidelines note that for lymph node involvement, "the differentiation of benign from metastatic locoregional nodes remains challenging." While accuracies for N-staging range from 59% to 83%, MRI has a high NPV (75%-87%) for ruling out nodal disease. The document acknowledges that early studies did not demonstrate improved accuracy for T-staging with contrast, but also cites newer evidence suggesting contrast may be helpful in specific scenarios (e.g., small tumors, mucinous tumors, significant motion artifact) and that many practices use it routinely.

*   **Variant 3: Rectal Cancer - Locoregional Staging (Post-neoadjuvant therapy)**
    *   **Usually Appropriate:**
        *   **MRI pelvis without and with IV contrast.**
        *   **MRI pelvis without IV contrast.**
    *   **Rationale/Discussion Summary:** Post-treatment MRI is crucial for assessing response and determining eligibility for organ-sparing approaches. For nodal restaging, the guidelines state that lymph node size is a "slightly more reliable predictor of malignancy post-CRT" than at baseline. Nodes <5 mm are generally considered benign. However, the overall diagnostic accuracy for N-stage remains limited, with reported sensitivities of 60%-75% and specificities of 65%-71%.

**Conclusion Summary**
For both initial locoregional staging and post-neoadjuvant restaging of rectal cancer, **high-resolution pelvic MRI is the "Usually Appropriate"** and recommended modality. The ACR guidelines rate MRI with and without IV contrast as equally appropriate, acknowledging that while contrast is not universally mandated for T-staging, it may be beneficial in specific scenarios. The guidelines consistently highlight that **accurately staging lymph nodes remains a significant challenge** for standard MRI techniques.
